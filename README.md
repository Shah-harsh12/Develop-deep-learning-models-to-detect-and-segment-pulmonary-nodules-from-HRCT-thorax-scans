# Develop-deep-learning-models-to-detect-and-segment-pulmonary-nodules-from-HRCT-thorax-scans
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, where survival rates remain low due to late-stage diagnosis. Early and accurate detection is therefore essential to improve patient outcomes. In recent years, AI-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have shown promise in analyzing CT scans, but most existing approaches face limitations. Common gaps include reliance on imaging alone without clinical context, inability to classify fine-grained nodule and cancer subtypes, high false-positive rates, weak handling of small nodules in limited datasets, and a lack of explainability for clinical adoption.

This project proposes a comprehensive AI-powered pipeline designed to bridge these research gaps. The workflow begins with 3D U-Net segmentation for accurate lung and nodule isolation, followed by 3D ROI extraction. A 3D ResNet-18 encoder, pretrained on RadImageNet, is used for efficient and robust feature representation, particularly suited for medical imaging and small datasets. On top of these embeddings, multiple classification heads predict nodule type (solid, part-solid, GGO), malignancy probability, binary classification (SCLC vs NSCLC), and NSCLC subtypes (adenocarcinoma, squamous, large-cell).

To improve decision reliability, the system incorporates multimodal feature fusion, combining deep embeddings with radiomics and clinical data. These features are refined using a meta-classifier such as XGBoost or Logistic Regression, along with calibration techniques to reduce false positives and ensure clinically trustworthy probability scores. Furthermore, Grad-CAM explainability and Lung-RADS-like structured reporting are integrated to provide transparency and build clinical confidence in AI predictions. The system also extends to longitudinal analysis, enabling growth rate tracking and follow-up assessment, which are critical for real-world patient management.

By combining segmentation, classification, multimodal integration, explainability, and longitudinal monitoring in one unified framework, this project addresses key shortcomings of prior CAD systems. The result is a robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant AI solution that not only improves early lung cancer detection but also supports ongoing patient care and decision-making.

Recommended System Requirements (for your lung cancer CT project)

CPU: Intel i7 / AMD Ryzen 7 (8 cores or more, so things run smooth)
RAM: 32–64 GB (3D CT scans are heavy, you’ll thank yourself for the extra memory)
GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3080 / 3090 / 4090 (10–24 GB VRAM — the GPU is the real workhorse here)
Storage: At least 1 TB SSD (datasets + models + checkpoints will eat space fast)
OS: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 (Linux works best with deep learning setups, though Windows is fine too)

Software

Python 3.10+
TensorFlow or PyTorch (main deep learning framework)
nnU-Net / MONAI (for segmentation and medical imaging workflows)
SimpleITK, pydicom (for CT/DICOM handling)
Jupyter / VS Code (for coding and experiments)
Git + Docker (to keep your environment clean and reproducible)
